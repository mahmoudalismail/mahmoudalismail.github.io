                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are meant to be just a sample of how to use and initialize the graph properly (refer to them to see how they are related to each other)<br><br>

                    			<code>Reduced Elements</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains the information that will be used to represent each of the reduced node-link diagrams after the dimenionality reduction of the original one<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is nessacry to have a copy for each one even if they share the same attributes, because of the changes that happen to them in the visualization stage (such as branch selection, dragging,...etc)<br><br>

                    			<code>Reduction Functions</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are just functions that take care of calling the reduction functions with their proper settings. To reduce the call and avoid mistakes and inconsistency, it is better to keep them this way so that changes the settings occurs only at one place<br><br><br>

								<code>get_centroids()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A function that gets the data (centers and average grade values) from the HTML file and creates the original non-reduced clusters and graph structure<br>

								<code>jsonStr()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not nesscary but added in cases of arrays just in case a browser fails to convert an array into a JSON object directly<br>

								<code>init_reduce()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Handles the dimensionality reduction of the original graph structure and creates a new graph for each reduction type<br>                    
                    			<p>
                    				For the details of how to properly initialize the graph to work with the node-link diagram refer to the example in the top of the script file.

										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>links</code>: An array of links that links the centroids<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>clusters</code>: An array of the cluster set, is not used in the functionality of the function but is needed for the creation of the node-link diagram<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>graph</code>: A reference to the graph that is to be reconstructed. Must be an existing graph<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>SVG ID</code>: For the nodelink() function to be given to the created SVG<br>
										<p>
											Given the above parameters the function resets and recalculates the nodes and the links of edges of the graph, then creates a new node-link diagram with the specified ID.
										</p>
										<br>
								<code>changeDR()</code> Function<br>
                            			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Parameters: </b><br>
                            			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>algorithm</code>: The name of the algorithm to which the view should be switched to<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>reconstruct</code>: A boolean variable that determines whether the graph should be reconstructed due to changes in the parameters or not<br>
										<p>
											Given the above parameters the function hides every SVG element in the view, the based on the specified <code>algorithm</code> it will show the SVG element that is associated with it. If the value of <code>reconstruct</code> was true, the function will call <code>reconstruct()</code> with the corresponding arguments.

								<h4>Events Section</h4>
								<hr>
								<code>kmeansUpdate.submit()</code> Event Handler
								<br>
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>init_colorScales()</code>: Sends an AJAX request to the server to recalculate the K-means algorithm with a new number of clusters. Upon success, the it changes the attributes in the HTML element that holds the data of the graph, calls <code>get_centroids()</code> -documented previously- and <code>init_reduce()</code> -documented previously- to recalculate the whole thing<br>

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>switch_opts_algos(), switch_opts_red(), switch_clr_scales()</code> Functions: Are used to show and hide certain elements based on their specified targets (called through the proper event handlers in the HTML file)<br>

								<h4>Graph Structure</h4>
								<hr>

								<code>Nodes and Edges</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Array of nodes and edges for the graph (refer to their documentation for more information)<br>
                    			<br>

                    			<code>Selection</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An array of the indices of the selected nodes in the graph, represent a selected branch<br>
                    			<br>

                    			<code>Threshold</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value that will be used to filter out some edges; if their weight is less than the threshold they will not be considered edges<br>
                    			<br>

								<code>N-L Map</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The node-link map, used as a lookup table for the connected edges<br>

                    			<ul style="padding-left: 70px;">

                    				<li>Is some sort of a hashmap to make retrieving data faster</li>

                    				<li>JavaScript does not have an implementation of a hashmap, but its objects can serve as hashmaps due to their structure and the way they operate</li>

                    				<li>Is formatted as follows { node key : [ [ [the index of a child, the weight of the edge], ... ], [ [the index of a parent, the weight of the edge], ... ] ], node key : ... }</li>

                    			</ul>
                    			<br>

                    			<code>addNode()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given a node, the function assigns a new index to it which is its index in the <code>nodes</code> array. Then it creates a new key in the <code>nlMap</code> which is going to be the index of that node<br>
								</p>

								<code>findChildren()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gets the list of children of a certain node from <code>nlMap</code>  given its index. Then the children are filtered after the weights of their edges are tested against the threshold, leaving only the ones that are greater than or equal to the threshold value<br>

								<code>findParents()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same as <code>findChildren()</code> but works in the other direction<br>

                    			<code>findEdge()</code> Function<br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loops through the array of edges to find an edge between that node having the index of <code>_source_index</code> and the one having the index of <code>_target_index</code>. The indices are interchangable, it does not matter in which order they are passed. Should use <code>nlMap</code> instead of <code>edges</code> array<br>
                    			<br>

								<code>Visited</code><br>
                    			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An array of the previously visited nodes. It was made to avoid infinite loops that happen because of revisiting the same nodes multiple times<br>
                    			<br>

								<div class="alert alert-warning">
									The <code>visited</code> array must be reset after each call for any of the branch functions, but not inside the functions. Finding branchs is recursive, it can be defined and reset inside the functions but that will require some changes to them, having the list outside the function and reseting it independently is more convenient and safer

									<b>Parameters: </b><br>

                            		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>target index</code>: The index of the node which the function should stop when reached

                            		<p>
                            			Given the source and the target, the function tries to find a set of nodes that link those two nodex. The functions use breadth-first search to find the nodes that make the branch. The functions were implemented first as depth-first but then BFS was found to be more approperiate, therefore, the implementation is not a good BFS but rather a DFS with one step before it.

									</div>

									<b><code>ode_default_opts</code> Object</b><br>
									Holds the default options that are to be used in the <code>nodelink()</code> to customize the attributes of the elements<br>
									<ul>
										
										<li><code>sizeScale()</code> Function : scales the size passed to it according to its ratio from <code>minSize</code> to <code>maxSize</code> attributes
										</li>

										<li><code>color_func</code> Function : maps a certain attribute of a node to a color based on the value of <code>colorScale</code>. It is there for a default setting, but is not the one the actual one being used, it works if the colors of the nodes were not set manually</li>

										<li><code>radius_func()</code> Function : based on the size of the node (the number of elements its cluster contains), the function gives that node a propr radius to represent it. In fact it maps the area to work better with big numbers but the equation is rearranged to give the radius</li>
									</ul>

									<code>clear_selection()</code> Function<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resets the selection array of a graph, and resets the elements in an SVG to their normal settings (resets the visual representation of a selected branch)<br>
									
									<br>

									<h4>Nodelink Structure</h4>
									<hr>
									<b>Parameters: </b><br>
									<ul>
										<li><code>graph</code>: The graph which has the nodes and the edges to be visualized</li>

										<li><code>clusters</code>: An array of the clusters that correspond to the nodes of the graph</li>

										<li><code>element ID</code>: The array of the div where the SVG will be added</li>

										<li><code>SVG ID</code>: The ID of the SVG that will be created</li>

										<li><code>opts</code> (options): A set of options that define the settings of the nodes (has to be in the same format as <code>node_default_opts</code>)</li>

										<li><code>force</code>: A boolean value that determines whether the diagram will rely on the default force-directed placement of the nodes (true) or the positions will be the same as the ones given by a dimensionality reduction algorithm</li>
									</ul>

									<b>Settings:</b><br>
									<ul>
										<li><code>change_mode()</code>: switches between the 'select' mode and the 'drag' mode</li>

										<li><code>change_scale()</code>: swicthes between radius scaling modes. If 'true', it applies the <code>radius_fuc()</code> of the given <code>options</code></li>

										<li><code>set_threshold()</code>: filters the displayed edges based on the weight of that edge in <code>graph</code></li>

										<li><code>set_colors()</code>: maps the value of a grade feature of each cluster into a color for the node that represents it</li>
									</ul>

									<b>Nodes and Labels</b><br>

										<p>Note that the labels are drawn above the nodes, so that every label is above every other node. This makes it easier for the user to determine whether a node is covering a smaller one behind it or not, if that is not needed then they should be combined into one group ('g' element) to make manipulating them easier</p>

									<b><code>node_click()</code> Event Handler</b><br>

										<p>Handles selecting the nodes when the SVG has the attribute <code>mode</code> set to 'select'. Does not just do the selection visually, it calls the given graph to find a selection, then based on the result from the call of the function it selects the points. <br>

										It uses <code>safeBranch()</code> to find the branch between two points, previously it used <code>branch()</code> then when it fails it also checks <code>inverseBranch()</code> to find another way. After utilizing <code>safeBranch()</code> the other case should not be included, unless the graph was mean to be directed.</p>

									<h4><code>node_drag()</code> Behavior & Its Functions</h4>
									<hr>

									<div class="alert alert-warning">
    										refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Drag-Behavior">D3 Drag Behavior</a> for detailed documentation of how it works
									</div>

									<b><code>force_start()</code>: Event Handler</b>
										<p>
											The handler is only called once, that is when D3 starts to draw the elements. At that stage D3 assigns values to the positions of the nodes (d.{x, y}) and their links (d.{source, target}.{x,  y}). In the case of force-directed graph (<code>force</code> is set to be true), the handler does not forcefully set the value for D3, it leaves the value D3 assigned the way it is.
											<br>
											In the case of not wanting a force-directed graph, the handler calls <code>force.stop()</code>, since there is no point in recalculating the positions again. However, with the force-directed graph, it lets D3 continue its caluclations.
										</p>

									<b><code>force_tick()</code>: Event Handler</b>

										<p>
											A normal classic tick handler, it just repositions the nodes, edges, and labels based on their location if it was changed from the previous one.
										</p>

									<b><code>force_end()</code>: Event Handler</b>
										<p>
											Pretty much the same as the <code>force_tick()</code> handler, but is to be called when either D3 stops changing the position of the points, or when the <code>force.stop()</code> function is called.
										</p>

									<br>

									<h4>Zoom Behavior</h4>
									<hr>
										<p>
											Refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3680999">SVG Geometric Zooming Example</a>
										</p>

									<br>

									<h4>Bugs and Errors</h4>
									<hr>
										<ul>
											
											<li>After zooming, the nodes are both scaled and shifted based on the focal points. However, the tooltip does not go with that, therefore after scaling the position of the tooltip will not be the same as the hovered node.
											<br>  
											Failed attempt: using <code>d3.mouse(this)</code> inside the event handler for <code>hovered</code> event did not work.
											<br>
											Suggested action: remove the focal point and always zoom into one certain point, in this case it is fairly to locate the new position of the node.
											</li>

											<li>Sometimes after doing some work with the large scatter plots, the node-link SVG disappears either partially or entirely. The causes of the bug are unknown, and attempts to reporoduce it intentionally to find a scenario where this bug occurs failed</li>
										</ul>

									<br>

									<h4>Suggestions</h4>
									<hr>
										<ul>
											<li>Instead of going through the hassle of trying to locate the hovered node and position the tooltip accordingly, it might be a good idea to have a small box in one of the corners, it serves as a tooltip but it doesn't move based on the node's position. The box might be draggable as well to make it more convenient to the user</li>

	                					<p>
	                						Generates a point that will most likely form a normal distribution with the other points generated by that functions. The more the number of the calls of the function, the more normal the points are distributed
	                					</p>


                					<b><code>generta_conflicting()</code> Function: </b><br>
	                					
	                					<p>
	                						Generates consecutive points that conflict with each other in some dimensions. The function does not generate a set of points, it generates one point with each call, but its static parameters ensure that some points will have the save value in some dimensions
	                					</p>

                					<b><code>loop()</code> Function: </b><br>

	                					<p>
	                						A widely used function in almost every script file. It wraps the for loop but it loops through all the elements (<code>loop()</code> required setting the lower bounds and upper bounds of the loop). Makes the script more dynamic, shorter, and easily modifible but lacks in performance since it introduces a function call inside the body of the loop instead of just executing the instructions directly.
	                						<br>  
											It is better to replace the <code>each()</code> calls with normal 'for' loops for better performance.

	                						Gets the parameters of the line by calling <code>regression_params()</code>, then it calculates the starting and ending points of the regression line.  
	                						<br>
											The first point lies at <code>x = 0</code>, and by substituting in the line equation <code>y = b</code>. The other points is at <code>x = _xLim</code>, while <code>y = (m * _xLim) + b</code>
