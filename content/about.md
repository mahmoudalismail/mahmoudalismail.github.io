## About

Welcome! I'm **Mahmoud**, and this site is my digital space for sharing ideas, learnings, and experiments. My background is in Computer Science, with experience in Machine Learning, Speech, and Audio. I would expect content covering these topics, along with occasional thoughts on books I read, productivity, and other interests.

This website has been online since 2014 but hasn't seen much activity or content until recently. Some of the notes you will find here go back a while. I have been gradually collecting and publishing them online so theyâ€™re easier to share and revisit. They reflect both older explorations and current projects.  

If you spot a typo, have feedback, or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach me at **[hello@mahmoudalismail.com](mailto:hello@mahmoudalismail.com)**.  

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful or inspiring here!
